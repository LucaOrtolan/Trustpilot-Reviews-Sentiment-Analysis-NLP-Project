# Trustpilot-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis-NLP-Project

This NLP project uses reviews of the internet company HughesNet scraped from Trustpilot.com to train a LSTM neural network with the task of predicting whether a review is positive (more than 3 stars) or negative (less than 3 stars). <br>
The repository has two notebooks: one with the webscraping code and the other with the machine learning part. The neural network's architecture has been made by Shency Jose in this Kaggle project https://www.kaggle.com/code/shencyjose/lstm-sentiment-analysis. <br>
The webscraped data can can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lucaortolan/trustpilot-reviews-for-sentiment-analysis.
